# 1 Task:
Strings in Python are compared based on character values.
It is required to create a RealString class in which to implement a comparison of strings by the number of characters included in them.
You can compare with each other both class objects and ordinary strings with instances of the RealString class.
Implement the isPalindrom() method, which returns True or False depending on whether the word is a palindrome.

# 2 Task:
Implement the Real_text class. The element of which is a list of RealString elements.
Implement in this class a constructor for reading words from a file.
Implement method + sum of two instances, i.e. Real_text = Real_text + Real_text.
Implement a method to save Real_text to a file. Don't forget to save words separated by spaces.
